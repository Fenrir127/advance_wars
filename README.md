# advance_wars
 
Welcome to our version of Advance Wars: Basic Wars!

Upon loading the project, make sure you have a version of PyGame installed. Muy importante.

Other than that, you can modify the setting.py file IOT run another scenario. You can change SCENARIO to STALEMATE, RUNAWAY or ATTACK. 
If you do so, make sure you change the pickle file to load! The comments should tell you what needs to be done, but unless you want to train an AI,
all parameters should be set to 0 and you should be good to go.

Enjoy!
